# DAMBAZTOKEN Smart Contract

## Overview

The DAMBAZTOKEN Solidity smart contract is crafted to establish a fundamental ERC-20 token with additional functionalities. Key features include:

- **Minting**: Reserved exclusively for the contract owner, granting authority to create new tokens.
- **Transfers**: Empowers any user to transfer tokens to other addresses.
- **Burning**: Provides users the ability to burn their own tokens, thereby reducing the total supply.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity version 0.8.19 or higher

## Contract Details

### Token Properties

- **Name**: Set during contract deployment, accessible via the `name()` function.
- **Symbol**: Also configured during deployment, retrievable through the `symbol()` function.
- **Decimals**: The token adheres to a fixed decimal value of 18.

### Ownership

- The contract incorporates an ownership concept, designating a privileged owner with special rights.

### Events

- **Transfer**: Triggered when tokens move from one address to another.
- **Approval**: Activated when the owner sanctions another address to spend a specified token amount.
- **Minted**: Launched upon the minting of new tokens, subsequently added to a designated address.

### Functions

1. **Constructor**
   - Initializes the contract with the token name, symbol, and designates the deployer as the owner.

2. **onlyOwner Modifier**
   - A tailored modifier constraining specific functions to the contract owner.

3. **mint**
   - Permits the owner to mint new tokens, allocating them to a specified address.

4. **burn**
   - Empowers any user to burn their own tokens, resulting in a reduction of the total supply.

5. **transfer**
   - Facilitates any user in transferring tokens to another address.

6. **name, symbol, decimals**
   - Getter functions to extract token information.

7. **totalSupply**
   - Reports the total supply of tokens.

8. **balanceOf**
   - Indicates the token balance of a specified address.

9. **approve**
   - Allows the owner to endorse another address to spend a particular token amount.

10. **allowance**
    - Reports the quantity of tokens approved for spending by a designated spender.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract, specifying the token name and symbol.
2. The owner can then mint new tokens through the `mint` function.
3. Users are free to transfer tokens utilizing the `transfer` function.
4. Individuals can burn their own tokens by using the `burn` function.
5. The `approve` function facilitates the owner in granting spending approval to another address.
6. Token details can be retrieved using the various getter functions.

## Important Notes

- Safeguard the contract owner's private key securely, given its authority to mint new tokens.
- Exercise caution with the `approve` function, as it involves granting spending permission to another address.
